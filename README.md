# Welcome to my GitHub page

Hi there! I'm **Hugo**, a curious and creative French 🇫🇷 Data Scientist.  
My work blends **machine learning**, **forecasting**, and **data-driven storytelling** to bring actionable insights to the games we build.

From building predictive models that anticipate player behaviour to designing automated systems that empower decision-making,  
I love turning data into powerful game-changing tools.

I work in the Gaming Industry, and I have  had the chance to work on various major titles. From simulation video games to FPS, I covered a wide range of genres.
Currently I am working @QuanticDream, helping the team use insights to help in the development of titles.


I enjoy football ⚽, chess ♟️, and python 🐍 programing.
